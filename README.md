# Multiple-Sclerosis-RNA-Seq
See Wiki section for information about the project.

# Functionality 
The initial input files were provided by Dr. Chen and made accessible to us on our class server. Each experimental group has three FASTQ files of RNA Seq transcripts.  Kallisto quantification is run using the generated index and the transcript FASTQ files(**See Kallisto script Project_6.py**). After that, the three output files produced by Kallisto for each of the experimental groups are read in by Sleuth, and the comparisons: CFA vs. Vehicle, CFA vs. Sephin1, and Vehicle vs. Sephin1 between the groups are done. Within Sleuth, the Wald test function is included to compute the specific beta coefficient of every transcript, which is necessary for WebGestalt(**See Sleuth code Sleuth_WaldTest.R**). Furthermore, the transcript IDs are converted to gene IDs using Biomart. Next, a table is generated with two columns for gene IDs and their beta coefficients. This table is uploaded to the web-based WebGestalt for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). GSEA will allow for the extraction of biological insight from genes of interest and generate heatmaps, volcano plots, and aid in visualizing changed pathways. The final output files of our pipeline include a gene list and the plots generated by WebGestalt.

# Updates

## April 21, 2023

- re-editing of Sleuth code to produce proper output files necessary for WebGestalt
- removal of the old Kallisto output files
- re-editing of the R - script that runs sleuth to produce necessary outputs
  - Plotting the top target id and saving as PNG file 
  - making a ranked gene list using Ensembl gene IDs which will be used for Webgestalt (More work needed on this part)
